# How to contribute

Hi! I'm really happy you want to help out with `hcltm`. This repo is the GitHub action wrapper for the `hcltm` utility. If you need changes in `hcltm` please view it here: https://github.com/xntrik/hcltm

At this early stage, the best way to get started is to [Submit an Issue](https://github.com/xntrik/hcltm-action/issues) or [Submit a PR](https://github.com/xntrik/hcltm-action/pulls).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to hcltm-action](https://github.com/xntrik/hcltm-action/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). When you send a pull request, we will love you forever if you include tests as well. We can always use more test coverage. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Thanks,
Christian @xntrik Frichot
